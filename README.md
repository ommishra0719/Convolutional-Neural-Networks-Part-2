# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-Part-2
Continuation of part 1 with backpropagation included to update weights and to improve accuracy as well as loss.
This project only utilises the numpy library to create a CNN for the MNIST dataset.
The neural netwrok consists of three layers - convolutional layer, pooling layer and the softmax layer.
